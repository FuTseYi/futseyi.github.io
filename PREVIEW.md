# Development & Preview

The website is built from source into a portable static directory, `_site/`. The current local preview uses Python 3.10 or newer.

## Getting Started

From the repository root:

```powershell
# Windows
py -3 preview.py
```

```sh
# macOS / Linux
python3 preview.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8765/> or <http://127.0.0.1:8765/blog/>. Saving a source file triggers a rebuild; refresh your browser to see the result. Stop with Ctrl+C, and run only one preview process per checkout.

Dependencies come from `requirements.txt`. If needed, the command installs them into a project-local `.venv` (or the active virtual environment), not the system Python. Initial setup requires internet access and working `venv`/`pip` support. The preview retains the previous successful build if a rebuild fails.

## Building & Output

```sh
python3 preview.py --build-only
python3 preview.py --build-only --refresh-activity
```

On Windows, substitute `py -3` for `python3`.

- `--build-only`: Generate and verify `_site/` without serving it.
- `--refresh-activity`: Fetch fresh public contribution data instead of reusing an available snapshot.
- `--port 8766`: Choose another local preview port.

Vercel uses the repository-owned `vercel.json` to invoke `python3 preview.py --build-only --refresh-activity` and publish `_site/`. GitHub Pages uses the same builder with `--refresh-activity` for its scheduled updates. After a successful scheduled or manually dispatched Pages publish, the workflow creates one empty `chore: refresh recent open contributions` commit on `main` to request a Vercel Git deployment. Ordinary source pushes do not create refresh commits. Keep these hosts as adapters around the one build pipeline.

Recent Open Contributions is a **display name**, not a 365-day data cutoff: every build scans the account's lifetime using year-scoped GitHub GraphQL collections (attributed commits, opened PRs and issues, and submitted reviews), plus historical PR and comment searches. When a single GitHub query would exceed its repository or 1,000-search-result limit, the time range is split instead of silently dropping older repositories. PR-head commits and comments count only when GitHub attributes them to `FuTseYi`; another person's PR update never changes the personal activity date. The two excluded repositories are `FuTseYi/futseyi.github.io` and `FuTseYi/FuTseYi`. All verified publicly accessible repositories, including archived projects, are retained and sorted by their latest verified personal activity; the homepage shows the first three until **Show more** reveals all remaining repositories. The generated `_site/contributions.json` is not a separately maintained source of truth.

GitHub API history is not a guaranteed exhaustive audit: deleted/private records, contributions GitHub does not attribute or index, and some non-PR discussion types cannot be reliably reconstructed. GraphQL history requires `GITHUB_TOKEN`; without it the build uses REST commit search, which omits some review and issue-contribution history. The same build entry point is used by both hosts; credentials never enter static assets. GraphQL's current public repository visibility and metadata are reused directly, avoiding a redundant public REST request for every historical repository. Only repositories discovered exclusively through supplemental REST activity require separate public metadata checks; these are queried anonymously when external to the account. When a fine-grained token cannot search other public repositories (HTTP 422), issue/PR search retries anonymously with GitHub's lower public search rate limit. If supplemental search still fails, verified GraphQL contributions remain visible with a `Partial API coverage` marker rather than hiding the entire list. On API failure, an existing **local** snapshot is used with its original timestamp; a new build without one preserves the homepage's activity link rather than claiming that stale results are complete. Because both hosts independently rebuild history, they need not produce byte-identical snapshots at the same moment.

The same build entry point is used for verification and the current publishing workflow. It generates the blog and search index, synchronizes staged homepage content, and checks the output. Generated `blog/`, `_site/`, and `sitemap.xml` are ignored by Git.

The canonical origin in `index.html` determines generated article URLs, sitemap entries, and README links. Internal navigation uses root-relative paths. Hosting, domain, and credential settings belong outside the portable build.

## Writing & Publishing

Create `posts/my-note/index.md`:

```markdown
---
title: My note
date: 2026-10-28
tags: Notes, Website
---

Article text goes here.
```

`title` and `date` are required; `tags` and `lang` (`zh-CN` or `en`) are optional. The article title becomes the page H1; headings in the body are shifted down one level while retaining their anchors. Dates determine display order, not scheduled publication.

Keep article media beside its source in `posts/my-note/assets/` and link to files such as `assets/example.webp`. Use meaningful alt text for informative images, empty alt text for decorative images, and `<figure>`/`<figcaption>` when a caption is needed. The folder name forms the public URL (`/blog/my-note/`), so avoid changing it after publishing.

Under the current workflows, changes reaching `main` publish the site and trigger README synchronization.

## Browser Verification

Run the build check above for site or publishing changes. The repository's PR workflow additionally runs Python unit tests and Chromium and WebKit browser smoke tests.

Static checks cover generated pages and links but cannot establish visual or interaction correctness. For relevant changes, verify narrow and wide layouts, both color themes, keyboard use, reduced motion, and direct page loads. Exercise same-page and cross-page links, browser Back/Forward, the mobile menu, Blog search, article contents, and code copying. Inspect representative image-, table-, and code-heavy articles when rendering changes.

## Implementation Notes

The generated blog reuses header/footer markup from `index.html`, while `style.css` and `site.js` serve the site as a whole. When Swup is available, same-origin navigation replaces `#main` while shared UI and the WebGL atmosphere remain mounted. Ordinary document navigation remains the fallback if Swup is unavailable.

Page-specific interactions in `site.js` must initialize for incoming content and clean up when that content is replaced. Review listeners, observers, timers, and dialogs for lifecycle leaks when changing navigation. Refer to the source for pinned dependency versions and implementation details rather than duplicating them here.

Preview, article, README, activity and browser regression checks live in `tests/`; generation and validation stay in `scripts/`. The homepage is edited directly in root `index.html`; generated blog pages reuse its header/footer. `scripts/site_build.py` owns this site's isolated content pipeline. No separate template directory or cross-repository runtime is required.
